# simple tweeter

## client:
The client terminal version has these features:
* writing new tweet 
* like tweets
* leave comments
## UI
Recently i've added a UI written by PyQT5, which the comment feature doesn't work yet. but the UI design has it.

## server
The server uses socket programming to comunicate with the client.
- Also i used threading so it can talk to multiple clients at the moment and if one of them crashes servers stays running.
